# README

Welcome to `Twitter ðŸ”ª Scraper`.

**Note**. As og 14jan 2024, I'm abandoning this project as Twitter API permissions for free API usage have changed (thanks Elon).

Created by ricc with ricc's rails-app-scaffolder (also called `meta-scaffolder`).
Config yaml here: rails-app-scaffolder-sample.yaml

TODO(test recreation by changing one thing - as the problem arises)

* Ruby version: 2.7.2

* Database creation: rake db:migrate

* Database initialization: rake db:seed (this is AWESOME! It keeps parsing twits from the INTERNECHE ({*}))

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions:

  * Install/configure gcloud
  * create proper ENV variables
  * gcloud auth configure-docker

## install

Make sure you have Twitter APIs enabled. Instructions: TODO.

    cp .env.dist .env
    vim .env # edit away with your 3 vars.

See it in prod:

## TODO

* Skaffold / Cloud Deploy / Tekton
* make `rake db:seed` be able to run in PROD on cloud run (probably via a HTTP GCF trigger and an endpoint I can call via Rails API.. like /actions/blah)
  so i dont need to leave my ocmputer run in background :) To do this, I need to add a background task which executes stuff in background to populate stuff. I see a few solutions: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42260752/daemon-vs-runner-vs-rake-tasks-vs-active-job runner seems the best, but also Daemon could be interesting. Also a simple HTTP endpoint whcih i then call with GCF. Lets start with wrapping the action in a simple `Tweet.call_twitter_apis(search)`. Whatever happens, I need to converge the functionality in there. With both HTML and TXT output.
  On 26feb i've done that:

     * Created a HTTP endpoint under /games/actions/seed_by_search_term
     * cofigured a Cloud Scheduler to call it every 3 minutes
     * no GCF was hurt or damaged during this sdocumentary :) Just Clud Scheduler (basically a `cron * * * * * curl http://URL/dowload_all`)
     * The only part was adding Twitter API keys to prod/staging which should be a big deal froms ecurity perspective. The alternative is to pass it as
       HTTP querystring param and it scares me a bit more.

* Live updates. I've delved into it but DHH example in video is (awesome) depending on fact that update is on
  comment which is  child of post. Would be too complicated to adapt to my 1:1 case (not 1:many) since I dont
  have a cheap BIG subscription room (post 123) where all comments update stuff, I would have plenty of rooms
  with a single element. I guess the next step is for me to implement a rails chat and once that is done I go
  back to solving this problem. https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html#terminology-broadcastings

## Bugs

My new Mac M1 doesnt build docker/ruby very well, given M1 chipset. Some docs:

## Notes

Created with my awesome `rails-app-scaffolder` code, soon open sourced if you ask me.
To understand how it works, juist look at the YAML and you'll immediately know what it does: `rails-app-scaffolder-sample.yaml`.
