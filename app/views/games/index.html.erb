<h1>🎮 Games ⚽</h1>

<p>
A 🛡️ game ⚔️ is a couple 🟩[ wordle_type, and 📅daily📆  game].
They correspond to a unique solutio which i do NOT have (but i found a DB online with all solutions for 2022! I could store it and only show PAST ones.)

It roughly correspond to a date YYYYMMDD but it doesnt coincide with midnight GMT (I presume?, unless coder is a fecking genius).
